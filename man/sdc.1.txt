NAME
       sdc - Self Decrypting Binary Generator

SYNOPSIS
       sdc [-Cv] [-k key_file] [-o out_file] [-t target] file

DESCRIPTION
       The  sdc  program  creates self decrypting binaries for common operating systems and architectures. The target file is encrypted using Blowfish in Ciphertext Feedback Mode (CFB) and appended to an executable which reads
       itself and attempts to decrypt the appended data when it is run.

COMMANDLINE OPTIONS
       -C
           Check if input file was generated by this program by comparing the executable with the included targets.

       -k key_file
           Read encryption/decryption key from file key_file.

       -t target
           Generate self decrypting binary for target instead of the default (the OS and Architecture that sdc was compiled for).  See TARGETS below for a list.

TARGETS
       linux_x86          - Linux x86 ELF
       windows_x86        - Windows x86 PE-COFF
       openbsd_x86        - OpenBSD x86 ELF
       openbsd_arm        - OpenBSD arm ELF (Zaurus)
       openbsd_sparc64    - OpenBSD Sparc 64 ELF
       freebsd_x86        - FreeBSD x86 ELF
       netbsd_x86         - NetBSD x86 ELF
       solaris_sparc      - Solaris Sparc ELF

TODO
       * Add compression of the file before encryption
       * MacOSX support
